<h1>AUTO-CORRELATION-AND-PSD</h1>

<h2>Aim</h2>

Write a program for Autocorrelation and Power Spectral Density (PSD) of signals in Scilab and verify the Wiener–Khinchin relation.

<h2>Equipments Needed</h2>

Computer with Intel i3 processor (or higher)
Scilab software

<h2>Theory</h2>

The Wiener–Khinchin theorem states that:

The Power Spectral Density (PSD) of a wide-sense stationary random process is the Fourier Transform of its autocorrelation function.

This relationship bridges the time-domain correlation and frequency-domain power representations of a signal.

<h2>Algorithm</h2>

Load or Define the Signal: Input your time-domain signal.
Compute Autocorrelation: Calculate the autocorrelation function of the signal.
Compute Power Spectral Density (PSD):
Estimate the PSD using either:
Fourier Transform of the autocorrelation function, or
Methods like Welch’s periodogram.
Plot Results: Visualize both the autocorrelation function and PSD.

<h2>Procedure</h2>

Refer to the algorithm and write the code for the experiment.
Open Scilab on your system.
Type your code in a new editor.
Save the file.
Execute the code.
If any errors occur, debug and re-run the program.
Verify the generated waveform using tabulation and model waveform comparison.

<h2>Program (Scilab Code)</h2>

<h2>Output</h2>

<h2>Result</h2>

Thus the Autocorrelation and PSD are executed in Scilab and output is verified.
